  <p>Hi <%= firstName %>,</p>
  <p>How are you? I know it's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months since we talked but I wanted to give you an update on what I've been up to.
  </p>
  <p>I've recently started coding, you can find a blog about my experiences  <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/cjkb90">here!</a>
  </p>
    <ul>
      <% for(var i=0; i<latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
      <ol>On <%=blogDate%> I wrote a post titled <a href=<%=blogLink%><%=blogTitle%>.</a>
      </ol>
        <% } %>
    </ul>

  <p>Talk soon,
    <br>Chris
